# Validated causal rules for the diagnostic extractor.
#
# Rules are added ONLY after validation against real failure cases:
#   1. Run the extractor on 20-30 real failure logs
#   2. Compare data-driven chains against team's confirmed diagnoses
#   3. Chains that consistently match reality become rules here
#
# Rules BOOST chain confidence, they don't OVERRIDE data-driven findings.
# If a rule contradicts the data (rule says A->B but they never co-occur),
# a WARNING is generated in the report.
#
# Format:
#   - name: human-readable rule name
#     root: (node, template_pattern) of the root cause
#     downstream: list of (node, template_pattern) downstream effects
#     confidence: how much to boost chain confidence (0.0-1.0)
#
# Example (DO NOT ADD until validated):
#   - name: "depth_camera_cascade"
#     root: ["/dl_infer", "overdark"]
#     downstream:
#       - ["/depthcam_fusion", "Tf tranform failed"]
#       - ["/homo_fusion_tracker_node", "localization_status  #"]
#     confidence: 0.8
